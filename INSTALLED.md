# Thanks for installing npmhub!

There's nothing to configure. Just surf around on GitHub and whenever you're viewing a repo with npm dependencies, you'll see them listed below the README. For a good example, check out these two dependency lists:

- [**github.com**/sindresorhus/delay#dependencies](https://github.com/sindresorhus/delay#dependencies)
- [**gitlab.com**/Rich-Harris/buble/tree/master#dependencies](https://gitlab.com/Rich-Harris/buble/tree/master#dependencies)
